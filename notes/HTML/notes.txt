HTML Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements that define the different parts of the content.


HTML Elements:

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
Example:
html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>


HTML Tags:

Tags are the element names surrounded by angle brackets.
Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag <tagname> and a closing tag </tagname>.
Example of a paired tag:
